Test Suite Tags
===============

The .tml files under the `test/` directory have a tags line that looks like
this:

```
  tags: block sequence mapping spec
```

The table below defines the tags that must be used.
This table is used by tools to validate the tags.

```
These tags can have one of the following for '*':

  ok          YAML is valid

  want        YAML is invalid but should be valid
